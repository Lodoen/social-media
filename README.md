## Description
The JavaScript 2 course assignment was to create a new JavaScript front-end client for an existing social media platform, using a provided API. The API require authorisation via JSON Web Tokens. You have to login to access your token.
The breif tasked me with creating a user interface that allowed:
- Users with specific email accounts to register / login
- Users can view a post content feed
- Users can filter the post content feed
- Users can search the post content feed
- Users can view a post content item by ID
- Users can create a post content item
- Users can update a post content item
- Users can delete a post content item

This project also includes some of the optional tasks:
- User can create a comment on a post
- User can follow/unfollow a profile


The social media platform consists of 4 pages:
- A login / register new account page
- A home page for posting, viewing-, searching- and filtering a post feed.
- A post specific page, containing details about a selected post. This page is dynamically built based on the post ID.
- A profile page, containing details about a selected user. This page is dynamically built based on the username. If you are viewing a different user than yourself, you also have the ability to follow / unfollow the account.
